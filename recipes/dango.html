    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Skewered dumplings made with rice flour and glutinous rice flour, Hanami Dango are popular snacks enjoyed during cherry blossom viewing in Japan. <br> 
        These chewy dumplings in three colors (sanshoku dango) come in pink, white, and green springtime hues. With just a touch of sweetness, <br>
         this traditional Japanese confectionery announces the arrival of spring. <br> 
         As spring approaches, Japan turns into a shade of pink. It is a time of renewal of life and beauty, and we celebrate this turn of the season with <br>
        cherry blossom viewing (or Hanami in Japanese). A tradition that dated back as early as the 8th century.
         During the cherry blossom viewing, the Japanese also enjoy different types of wagashi (traditional confectionery) including Hanami Dango (花見団子).</p>

    <h2>What is Hanami Dango?</h2>
    <p>
        Hanami (花見) means flower viewing (of cherry blossom), and during this season, many people go out for strolls through the magnificent columns of the flowering trees. <br>
        The Japanese have long celebrated and admired the beauty of cherry blossoms by having picnics beneath the blooms. <br>
        At the picnics, we enjoy spring-themed foods in bento and wagashi which often incorporate seasonal flavors. <br>
        One of the popular sweets you can find at pop-up food stalls during the cherry blossom season is hanami dango (花見団子). <br>Dango is skewered sweet dumplings made with rice flour and glutinous rice flour. The dumplings come in pink, white, and green springtime hues, so they are also called sanshoku dango (三色団子). <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p> Joshinko (上新粉) - Japanese short-grain rice flour <br>
        Shiratamako (白玉粉) - Japanese short-grain glutinous rice flour, also known as sweet rice flour <br>
        Sugar - I use granulated sugar <br>
        Red food coloring - I use powder, but you can use gel <br>
        Match (green tea powder) or yomogi (mugwort) <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p> Mix together the joshinko, shiratamako, and sugar in a bowl. <br>
        Gradually add the measured boiling water and mix until well combined. <br>
        Divide the dough into thirds. Then, color one dango ball with a little bit of red food coloring and the next one with matcha (or yomogi). Keep the last one plain. <br>
        Divide each dough into 6 equal pieces and shape them into a nice, round ball. <br>
        Cook the dumplings (dango) in boiling water. Then, skewer the dumplings onto a bamboo skewer. Serve immediately. <br> </p>
