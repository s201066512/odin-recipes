    <h1>Ramen</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When you’re in Japan, you will quickly learn that there are 3 basic ramen flavors: shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), and miso (fermented soybean paste). <br>
        If you’re wondering about the tonkotsu ramen, that’s actually a type of broth base and the tonkotsu means a pork bone broth. If you’re interested in learning more about ramen, read our Japanese Ramen Guide for Beginners. <br>
        Today we’ll make the popular and my favorite, Miso Ramen (味噌ラーメン). <br></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p> ▢ 2 cloves garlic (1½ tsp minced garlic) <br>
        ▢ 1 knob ginger (½ tsp grated ginger) <br>
        ▢ 1 shallot <br>
        ▢ 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds <br>
        ▢ 1 Tbsp roasted sesame oil <br>
        ▢ ¼ lb ground pork <br>
        ▢ 1 tsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean sauce/broad bean paste) (for a non-spicy version, get a Taiwanese brand non-spicy doubanjiang; read the blog post for substitution and more info) <br>
        ▢ 3 Tbsp miso (each miso brand/type makes a slightly different broth) <br>
        ▢ 1 Tbsp sugar <br>
        ▢ 1 Tbsp sake <br>
        ▢ 4 cups Chicken Stock/Broth (homemade or store bought) (each ramen bowl requires about 1½ cups (360 ml) of broth + a bit more for evaporation; use vegetable stock for vegan/vegetarian) <br>
        ▢ 1 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt) (adjust according to your chicken broth) <br>
        ▢ ¼ tsp white pepper powder <br>
    
    For the Ramen and Optional Toppings:
    
        ▢ 2 servings fresh ramen noodles (10-12 oz or 283-340 g fresh noodles; 6.3 oz or 180 g dry ramen noodles; for gluten-free, use these GF ramen noodles) <br>
        ▢ Chashu (Japanese Braised Pork Belly; homemade or store bought) (you can buy it premade at a Japanese grocery store or make my Chashu at least a day in advance; skip for vegan/vegetarian) <br>
        ▢ Spicy Bean Sprout Salad (or blanched bean sprouts) <br>
        ▢ Ramen Egg (Ajitsuke Tamago) (sliced in half lengthwise; make my Ramen Eggs recipe at least a day in advance; skip for vegan) <br>
